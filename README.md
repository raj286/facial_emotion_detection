# Facial Emotion Detection

This project uses a deep learning model to detect facial emotions in real-time using a webcam.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raj286/facial_emotion_detection.git
   cd facial_emotion_detection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the real-time detection script:
   ```bash
   python realtimedetectionjson.py
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Keras
- NumPy

## Usage

Ensure your webcam is connected and run the script. The application will display the detected emotion in real-time.
